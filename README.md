# DatasetAgent

## Description

DatasetAgent is a tool designed to create datasets by processing images from various sources, making them suitable for machine learning tasks. It can augment images, generate anomalies, and organize data for efficient training.

## Features

- Extract images from videos at a specified frame rate (e.g., 1 image every 3 seconds)
- Convert YOLO datasets to image and mask pairs, with augmentations such as contrast adjustment, hue changes, and random transformations
- Crop images to desired sizes
- Rename and organize images into "good" and "bad" categories for easy training

## Software

- Python
- OpenCV
